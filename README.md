# Diabetes factors in sylhet region 

The early diagnosis of diabetes is only possible by proper assessment of both common and less common sign symptoms, which could be found in different phases from disease initiation up to diagnosis. Data mining classification techniques have been well accepted by researchers for risk prediction model of the disease. To predict the likelihood of having diabetes requires a dataset, which contains the data of newly diabetic or would be diabetic patient. 
In this study, secondary data has been used. I have used a dataset of 520 instances, which has been collected using direct questionnaires from the patients of Sylhet Diabetes Hospital in Sylhet, Bangladesh. Binary logistic regression model has been performed to identify the associated risk factors. 
Age, gender, genital thrush, polyuria, polydipsia, itching, irritability, and partial paresis have been identified as the main risk factors for receiving a diabetes diagnosis.
